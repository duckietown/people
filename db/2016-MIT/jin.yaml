bio:
  Lin is a Boston University Ph.D candidate working in the Szostak lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital. She studies the mysteries of the origin of life and her research involves building prebiotic "cells" from scratch. Though she does pure biology and chemistry bench work everyday, in her heart she still feels like an engineer, cherishing her engineering undergrad studies in Tsinghua University. Beyond her lab-born cells, Lin also likes to takes care of duckie babies as they swim across the ocean and build their new towns in other continents.

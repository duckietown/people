 bio: |
    Ingrid joined the Duckietown team after composing an award winning 
    song, <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/154418990">Duckiebots don't cry</a></em>. 
    She is passionate about songwriting, 
    singing, and dancing, particulary when not wearing any pants. 
    She has a strong affinity for duckies and creates dramatic 
    re-enactments with them during 
    the day and at bathtime. Ingrid's talents include falling off 
    her chair at the dinner table, being "a little bit cute and a
    little bit naughty", and riding her scooter.
